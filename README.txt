Basis for setting up strength training based on the type of pull (pull or push).

The basic configuration is set up for 3 days of training in which the different muscle groups are distributed according to their type of pull.

Day 1 - lower torso
Day 2 - shoulder, chest & triceps
Day 3 - back and biceps

In addition, the exercises are categorised based on the number of joints involved in the movement, so we have the following types:

Basic or compound: these involve several muscle groups and joints, and are fundamental in a strength training programme. They can be monoarticular or multi-joint.

Single-joint: Focus on a single muscle or joint. These exercises focus on working a specific muscle group and a single joint.
They usually involve less weight compared to multi-joint exercises.

Multi-joint: Involve multiple joints and muscle groups. These exercises require the movement of more than one joint and work several muscle groups at the same time. Due to the involvement of multiple muscles, a more complete stimulation of the musculoskeletal system can be achieved. They generally allow more weight to be lifted, which can contribute to an increase in overall strength and muscle mass.
